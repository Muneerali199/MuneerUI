# üîß GitHub Configuration Updates

## ‚úÖ All GitHub-related files have been updated!

---

## üìù Files Updated

### 1. **`.github/FUNDING.yml`** ‚úÖ
**Removed:** Old Ko-fi sponsor (davidhaz)  
**Updated:** Clean template ready for your sponsor links

```yaml
# Before:
ko_fi: davidhaz

# After:
ko_fi: # Add your Ko-fi username here
```

**You can now add your own funding platforms:**
- GitHub Sponsors: Add your GitHub username
- Ko-fi: Add your Ko-fi username
- Patreon: Add your Patreon username
- Buy Me a Coffee: Add your username
- Custom URLs: Add your PayPal or other donation links

---

### 2. **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/1-bug-report.yml`** ‚úÖ
**Updated references from "React Bits" to "MuneerUI"**

```yaml
# Before:
description: Help improve React Bits.
value: ## Thanks for trying to improve React Bits!
placeholder: https://github.com/DavidHDev/react-bits

# After:
description: Help improve MuneerUI.
value: ## Thanks for trying to improve MuneerUI!
placeholder: https://github.com/Muneerali199/MuneerUI
```

---

### 3. **`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/2-feature-request.yml`** ‚úÖ
**Updated references from "React Bits" to "MuneerUI"**

```yaml
# Before:
description: Suggest something for React Bits.
value: ## Thanks for trying to improve React Bits!
description: What would you like to see in React Bits?

# After:
description: Suggest something for MuneerUI.
value: ## Thanks for trying to improve MuneerUI!
description: What would you like to see in MuneerUI?
```

---

### 4. **`src/pages/ShowcasePage.jsx`** ‚úÖ
**Updated showcase image URLs**

```jsx
// Before:
src={`https://davidhaz.com/react-bits-showcase/showcase-${index + 1}.webp`}

// After:
src={`/assets/showcase/showcase-${index + 1}.webp`}
```

Now showcase images will be loaded from your own domain instead of external URLs.

---

## üéØ What This Means

### ‚úÖ No More Sponsor Button (Until You Add Your Own)
The "Sponsor this project" button on GitHub will no longer show the old Ko-fi link. It will be hidden until you add your own sponsor information.

### ‚úÖ Clean Issue Templates
When users report bugs or request features, they'll see "MuneerUI" everywhere instead of "React Bits".

### ‚úÖ Your GitHub Repository
All issue template links now point to `Muneerali199/MuneerUI` instead of the old repository.

### ‚úÖ Local Showcase Images
Showcase images will now load from your domain (once you add them to `/public/assets/showcase/`).

---

## üí° How to Add Your Own Sponsor Links

Edit `.github/FUNDING.yml` and add your usernames:

```yaml
# Example:
github: Muneerali199
ko_fi: muneerali
patreon: muneerali
buy_me_a_coffee: muneerali
custom: ['https://www.paypal.me/muneerali']
```

Once you add at least one platform, the "Sponsor" button will appear on your GitHub repository with your information!

---

## üìÅ Showcase Images Setup (Optional)

If you want to use the showcase feature, create this folder structure:

```
public/
  assets/
    showcase/
      showcase-1.webp
      showcase-2.webp
      showcase-3.webp
      etc...
```

Or you can disable the showcase page if you don't need it.
